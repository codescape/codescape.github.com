Configuration
-------------

Most aspects can be configured inside the `_config.yml` file.

Creating a gallery
------------------

To create a gallery simply upload the pictures and include them into a post in this way:

<div class="gallery markdown="1">
  ![My first picture](/folder/to/first-picture.jpg)
  ![My second picture](/folder/to/second-picture.jpg)
  ![My third picture](/folder/to/third-picture.jpg)
</div>

Including a Bikemap route
-------------------------

To include a Bikemap route look up the route id from the Bikemap.

{% assign route = "ROUTE_ID" %}
{% include bikemap_map.html %}
