Creating a gallery

To create a gallery simply upload the pictures and include them into a post in this way:

<div class="gallery markdown="1">
![My first picture](/folder/to/first-picture.jpg)
![My second picture](/folder/to/second-picture.jpg)
![My third picture](/folder/to/third-picture.jpg)
</div>
